It was unjust as we were received our first paycheck after a month which showed that amount. Then after a few days, we were informed that they had overpaid us, and that the salary agreed by the admin had to be adjusted. So the overpayment was deducted from the next salary. Primarily, we signed a contract that did not indicate how much we would receive as the HR said that the admin still had to decide on the amount to give. What the admin says is absolute. The healthcare industry is composed of underpaid PROFESSIONALS."

- The salary I stated is only a rough estimate (if i worked 5 hours a day, 5 days a week) as my pay depended on the number of classes I conducted
- Rate was 60/class(25 mins + 5 mins break) or 120/hr
- The hours were not fixed so we were ‘free’ to choose our schedule. However, students were from another country so I had to adjust my work time to their availability. Peak time was around 4am-8am in the morning and 6pm-11pm in the evening. I had to wake up really early or stay up late to book slots. 
- The workload was draining as I had to constantly talk and give my undivided attention on the student for the whole 25 minutes. Imagine doing that 5+ hours straight. I don’t want to sound ungrateful since I know that the pay is relatively higher compared to other jobs but personally, the rate was not worth the mental exhaustion.

1/24/2020 10:41:10,2014,Private owned company,ESL Teacher,10000,University of the Philppines Baguio,Femalr,Yes,"The 10,000/month salary had deductions from SSS, Philhealth, Pag-ibig and Tax. Which gives me 8,000 per month. I get my salary every 15th and 30th of the month, and I had to survive with 4,000 cut off. I have to pay rent, transportation, give back to parents and basically other bills like internet and postpaid plans. This leaves me with less than 2k per cut off for daily allowance. 

Transportation takes three rides, one jeepney ride (8.00php), one trike (15.00php-20.00php) and one bus to go inside the industrial park (13.00php). Multiply by 2 and then do it for five days.  

There aren't any cheap ""karenderya"" around the office nor do they sell cheaper food inside the canteen, so I opt to buy cooked food from canteens before I get inside SBMA. Just to make sure my allowance stretches out.  

Savings is just a dream. It's never achieved during this time. "

How do they expect me and my family to survive with me being the breadwinner with a salary of 8k per month in Quezon City even? I was already a licensed teacher when I joined that private school and was still paid that rate. I had to handle an entire year level with 4 sections with a minimum of 45 students each. I can't even complain because people would say ""You chose that path"" Guess what? If I didn't, then who would? If I weren't here suffering then somebody else would be. What I paid for my education, board exam review is more than what I'm earning right now. Honestly I feel like it's a waste. Loving what you do and being passionate about the field you're in doesn't even help your case when your job is like this. If this continues,  I'm quitting. I want to help our country but if doing so won't feed me and my family, I can't do it this way. Maybe I'll just volunteer. From a suffering person, honestly the salary in call centers sounds like an attractive option right now."

Across the board, salaries in esports are still very low, regardless of if you are in the backend, or as a talent (streamer, shoutcaster, pro player, etc). I've asked my coworkers as well as other people in the industry, and a lot, if not all of them, said that they are earning less than their previous jobs. Unless you're a big-name influencer who's caught the attention of big-name brands to sponsor you, or a famous streamer who can pull in big numbers, or a good pro player who wins big tournaments, you're not going to make a lot of money in esports. This sounds kinda salty but I'm really not. I'm glad we're all working towards a future where going into a career in esports is viable and sustainable and open for a lot of people. Behind the scenes, there're still positions like sales executives, account managers, project managers, graphic designers, photographers, videographers, video editors, audio engineers, talent managers, road managers, social media managers, writers, HR, accountants, legal, doctors, chefs, psychologists, therapists, and more; some esports organizations and companies are looking for a whole lot of people."

I don't think I'm that good of a software engineer yet and I'm not a good student but I do have some experience with hackathons, competitions, and funded projects etc. I had to really tailor my resume and Linkedin to get responses on my online applications. One day I received an interview invitation from a local crypto related company. 

The interview was basically just confirmations on my resume(no technical interview!!) and I got hired on the spot! I guess the company was quickly looking to fill the spot and maybe they liked what they saw on my resume.

If I have to give you a tip, I think applying for jobs even before your graduation is the key! You don't want to compete with tens of thousands of new IT graduates. And also, join competitions, do self projects, don't 100% rely on schoolwork because IT is a very competitive field. It is as competitive as it is rewarding though so, just make sure you work hard and pick the right companies not the dogshit exploitative WITCH companies here in the PH. 

The job I got is very good so far. <40 hour workweeks. No time-in time-outs, and I have an awesome team! Good luck on your search reader and may your hard work pay off!"
