I don't think I'm that good of a software engineer yet and I'm not a good student but I do have some experience with hackathons, competitions, and funded projects etc. I had to really tailor my resume and Linkedin to get responses on my online applications. One day I received an interview invitation from a local crypto related company. 

The interview was basically just confirmations on my resume(no technical interview!!) and I got hired on the spot! I guess the company was quickly looking to fill the spot and maybe they liked what they saw on my resume.

If I have to give you a tip, I think applying for jobs even before your graduation is the key! You don't want to compete with tens of thousands of new IT graduates. And also, join competitions, do self projects, don't 100% rely on schoolwork because IT is a very competitive field. It is as competitive as it is rewarding though so, just make sure you work hard and pick the right companies not the dogshit exploitative WITCH companies here in the PH. 

The job I got is very good so far. <40 hour workweeks. No time-in time-outs, and I have an awesome team! Good luck on your search reader and may your hard work pay off!"
